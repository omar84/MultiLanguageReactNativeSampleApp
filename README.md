# MultiLanguageReactNativeSampleApp
A simple demonstration of how to start building a multilingual mobile app using React Native

### Installation:
- install `node`. I use `nvm` to do that: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
- if you don't have `react-native-cli` installed, run: `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- install `yarn`: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
- clone this repo by running: `git clone https://github.com/omar84/MultiLanguageReactNativeSampleApp.git MultiLingualReactNativeSample`
- cd to the cloned app directory, then run: `yarn install`, then run: `yarn start` to start the react-native packager
- if you want to run it directly on your android phone, connect your device to your laptop/PC through USB, with USB Debugging turned ON. otherwise, you have to have your android simulator configured.
- open a new terminal tab, then run: `react-native run-android`

that's it!
